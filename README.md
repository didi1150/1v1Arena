1v1 Arena is a League of Legends inspired game, but since I don't have friends, I decided to make it a 1v1 game. 

To setup the arena, execute the following commands:

1. Stand on one of the two spawn positions and type /project addSpawn. Do it again for the other spawn
2. /project finish true to restart the server in a playable mode. /project finish false to restart the server in an edit-mode.

If you want to lower the remaining the cooldown when another player joins or when you are during the item select phase, do /project start.
